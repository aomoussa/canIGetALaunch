The Story of the Kite LIfe
Hello World, welcome to my app! I'm Ahmed, an experienced iOS developer kiter with a Computer Engineering degree, resisting tempting offers from the industry in a hail-mary attempt to prolong my fantasy life as a traveling kiter for a few more years. Committed to a lifelong pursuit of knowledge, documented hardware prototyping, and apple watch development projects are also underway for that short-term contract demand and updates on the industry are collected at various themed tech conferences. I made this app, this Summer of 2018, at the bay area, my favorite kitesuring destination so far with such diverse challenges (Crissy, *arnold schwarzenegger style:* **I'LL BE BACK** more prepared next time!). It is primarily aimed at providing a platform for description of the varying challenges at kiting spots on an interactvie map, to compliment the existing methods on the online forums. The crowdsourced data gathering would eventually allow continuously updated safety-critical information of spots, possible by upvoting/downvoting alternative parking/rigging/launching/waterstarting locations as well as map pins/regions for obstacles.

If drawing out your kite sessions all over the world and sharing them with fellow wind worshipers sounds as epic to you as it does to me, perhaps you would like to use the personal sessions map feature of the app, check it out!

Wanna see how your buddies living the kite life have been conquering beaches, lakes, and rivers around the world? Zoom in to see, these public sessions your friends wanted to share, close up:

If drawing out your kite sessions all over the world and sharing them with fellow wind worshipers sounds as epic to you as it does to me, you can use this session tracker functionality to save and display your kiteprints on an interactive map. Coming soon: pins for jumps higher than 10ft, pick bitmojis for the pins that capture your thoughts on the jumps! Hit me up if you wanna work together on a small cheap wifi camera that generates gifs of specific events or wifi wind meter for time-synchronized data on upwinding efficiency?
